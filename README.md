# Self-Driving AI Sim
The goal of this project is to create a simulation of a self-driving car by implementing car physics, sensors, collision detection, and neural networks among other things.

## Train Model
To see how the model is trained, open index.html in a browser. The training is complete when the car reaches the finish line (100% on the graph)

## Test Model
The "best brain" has already been saved in best-brain.js. Open test.html in a browser to test the trained car. Here, the traffic cars are randomly generated, meaning everytime you refresh, there is a different arrangement of cars. Feel free to refresh multiple times and see how the car reacts!
